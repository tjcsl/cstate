        <description>Incident Report, October 20, 9:00pm:
Based on our investigation, we have determined that a network issue involving Ion&#39;s backend cache database caused the HTTP 500 errors. This affected areas of Ion involving the use of the caching system, but core Ion webservers and databases remained functional. Upon restoration of the network connection, all areas of Ion became accessible. Timeout errors on Tin were caused by a separate, unrelated incident due to an unexpected load increase that temporarily overwhelmed the Tin server, causing it to restart and logout user sessions.</description>

&lt;b&gt;Incident Report, October 20, 9:00pm:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Based on our investigation, we have determined that a network issue involving Ion&#39;s backend cache database caused the HTTP 500 errors. This affected areas of Ion involving the use of the caching system, but core Ion webservers and databases remained functional. Upon restoration of the network connection, all areas of Ion became accessible.
Timeout errors on Tin were caused by a separate, unrelated incident due to an unexpected load increase that temporarily overwhelmed the Tin server, causing it to restart and logout user sessions. 
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. We have taken steps to prevent this from happening again, including resolving internal network issues on Ion and increasing memory and load capacity on Tin.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update, October 19, 1:15pm:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All services have been restored. Sysadmins are continuing to investigate the cause of the issues.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update, October 19, 8:40am:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A fix has been identified for unclickable links on the Ion Dashboard and will be deployed as soon as possible. Tin is adjusting to the higher load from computer science classes, and may respond slower than normal, but has been restored to normal functionality.&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Initial Announcement, October 18, 7:50pm:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting at 11pm on October 17, Ion started responding with 500 Internal Server Errors after a routine deployment. This was resolved midmorning October 18. However, some minor lingering issues persist including widget links on the right of the Dashboard intermittently not working. This can be circumvented using the left navigation bar. Some users are also reporting timeouts and/or session expirations on Tin; we encourage users to use a code editing application and upload a file instead of using the built-in web editor at this time. We apologize for the inconvenience; Sysadmins are working on complete restoration of services. We are also continuing to investigate the cause of the issues and will provide an update when we have more information.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>[Resolved] Web Services Down</title>
        <link>https://status.tjhsst.edu/issues/2022-05-22-systems-down/</link>

        <description>Several of our web services unexpectedly went down in the morning of May 22, 2022. After several days of investigation, we have restored the services to full operation.
We are not entirely sure what triggered the shutdown, but we do know that a crucial server managed by the TJHSST Tech Team crashed at some point between Friday 5/20 and Sunday 5/22, causing problems with our DNS servers (whose internal name resolution depended on said server).</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are not entirely sure what triggered the shutdown, but we do know that a crucial server managed by the TJHSST Tech Team crashed at some point between Friday 5/20 and Sunday 5/22, causing problems with our DNS servers (whose internal name resolution depended on said server). When we found a workaround for that issue in the evening of Sunday 5/22, we rebooted all servers. Unfortunately, one of our VM hosts experienced unexpected networking issues, causing all VMs on that host to be unavailable until they were moved to other servers on Tuesday 5/24. In addition, this reboot applied updates to kernel versions on our Ion and Director appservers, which broke communication between nodes on the Docker swarms for both services until the kernel was rolled back on Friday 5/27.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Resolved - November 15, 5PM: The issue has been resolved.
Director is now fully functional after a restart of the backend service. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.
Identified - November 15, 3PM: We have identified the issue and are working on a fix.
The issue is caused by an isolated backend service for the management interface currently being down; Sysadmins are working on restoring functionality.

        <title>[Resolved] Director Files Not Loading</title>

        <description>Users are reporting that the file explorer is not loading insude the Director online editor. We currently believe that we have resolved the issue, which was linked to heavy load on Director&amp;rsquo;s appservers. We have adjusted some backend parameters to make Director more performant under heavy usage.</description>

        <title>[Resolved] Web Services Down</title>
        <link>https://cstate.tjhsst.edu/issues/2022-05-22-systems-down/</link>

        <description>Several of our web services unexpectedly went down in the morning of May 22, 2022. After several days of investigation, we have restored the services to full operation.
We are not entirely sure what triggered the shutdown, but we do know that a crucial server managed by the TJHSST Tech Team crashed at some point between Friday 5/20 and Sunday 5/22, causing problems with our DNS servers (whose internal name resolution depended on said server).</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are not entirely sure what triggered the shutdown, but we do know that a crucial server managed by the TJHSST Tech Team crashed at some point between Friday 5/20 and Sunday 5/22, causing problems with our DNS servers (whose internal name resolution depended on said server). When we found a workaround for that issue in the evening of Sunday 5/22, we rebooted all servers. Unfortunately, one of our VM hosts experienced unexpected networking issues, causing all VMs on that host to be unavailable until they were moved to other servers on Tuesday 5/24. In addition, this reboot applied updates to kernel versions on our Ion and Director appservers, which broke communication between nodes on the Docker swarms for both services until the kernel was rolled back on Friday 5/27.&lt;/p&gt;
